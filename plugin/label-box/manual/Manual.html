<h3>Label Box</h3>
<p> 
Adds a box on the layers docker to choose color labels.
</p>

<img src="krita_20220713_0935.gif"/>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Once the plugin is installed you can just choose the color label and click to apply to selected layers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It also works if you put your mouse on top of the box and scroll.</li>
<li>It works for one or multiple layers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now one thing that people will notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>the color box will always stay in the last chosen color</strong>, even if you select a layer that already has a color label, the box will not be updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why doesnt the box update?</strong>
I just couldnt find a way to check if the current layer was changed, the signal of layer changed doesnt seem to be avaliable from the krita api so i can&#39;t really do much.</p>
